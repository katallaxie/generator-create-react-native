# A Yeoman React Native Generator

> I am somewhat sorry, because I know there is an other excellent project to get you start [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

## Getting Started

> We highly recommand to use `nvm` ([NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) to manage your Node versions, and to use the most recent versions

First, you have to install `yo`, as to use any [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) Generator. 

```
npm i -g yo
```

You install the generator by running the following command.

```
npm i -g generator-create-react-native
```

Have fun.

```
yo create-react-native
```

## Development

We can highly recommend to consult the Yeoman Guide to [write your own Yeoman Generator](http://yeoman.io/authoring/). Most importantly, to use the generator locally, you have to `npm link` the generator.
